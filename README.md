# Checkers Game

This is a simple implementation of the Checkers game using Python and Pygame. The game allows a human player to play against the computer. The computer uses the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to determine the best move.

## How to Play

- The game starts with the human player.
- Click on a piece to select it. The valid moves for the selected piece will be highlighted.
- Click on a highlighted square to move the selected piece to that square.
- The computer will then make its move.
- The game continues until one player has no pieces left or no valid moves.

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library
